# Todo List

- [ ] Fix Status Bar width mismatch (currently not matching the other boxes exactly).
- [ ] Fix Message Field scrolling behavior: prevent horizontal scrolling/wrapping issue where it scrolls to the next line view instead of creating a new line in the UI height properly when typing long words.
- [ ] Fix Message Field icons and prompt alignment when multi-line (ensure they stay at top or align properly).
